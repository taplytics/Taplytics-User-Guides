# 1. iOS Setup

To set up "Push" notifications for your app, please follow the instructions for your specific platform(s). Please note, you'll first have to install either our [iOS](https://github.com/taplytics/taplytics-ios-sdk/blob/master/START.md) or [Android](https://github.com/taplytics/Taplytics-Android-SDK/blob/master/START.md) SDKs before you integrate Push notifications. 

If you want to implement Push Notifications for [React Native](https://github.com/taplytics/taplytics-react-native), due to the nature of push notifications and their dependencies on the specific platforms, setup for each individual platform must be performed natively.
